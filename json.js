It’s undeniable that there has been some progress in certain sectors of human endeavour — sciences, various aspects of social and utilitarian organization that improve human life, technologies that expand those horizons still further (sometimes considerably—exponentially), cultural knowledge & understanding.  In the human species itself considered as an aggregate — not so much. We’re more horrible, more terrifying than ever — & in far greater numbers than the planet’s ecosystems can support. And yes — as temperamental as ever. There will be radical change. The only question is whether it will be sufficient to save most of the planet’s species/resources. As we look at it now, it promises to be absolutely terrifying."
