            Existential Issues:
            <br />A Mapping Exercise
          </h1>
          <p>
            In two of my recent exhibitions, I invited visitors to participate in a “Mapping Exercise” by taking a few minutes to fill out a questionnaire comprising a variety of existential questions. Participants were asked to mark their position with a dot on a series of diagrams.
          </p>
          <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>
            In total, 1222 people completed the questionnaire: 941 during the Sobey Art Award Exhibition at the Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton (October 5, 2019 to January 5, 2020), and 281 during my solo exhibition at Galerie Bradley Ertaskiran in Montreal (January 24 to March 7, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the scatterplot graphs below, each dot corresponds to the answer of one participant. The questions appear exactly as on the original questionnaire.

            <h2>Extras: drawings, lines and other</h2>
            <p>
              About 5-10% of the questionnaires included marks other than dots.
              Unfortunately, due to the most boring pragmatic limitations (time
              and budget), it is impossible to reproduce all of this here.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the majority of cases, the marks consist in one or more
              additional dots, one or several lines, or a shape enclosing an
              area of a graph. Sometimes (in about 1 or 2% of cases), it is a
              drawing or an inscription. Usually, when possible, we simply
              considered the location of these marks on the graph as if it was a
              dot.
            </p>
            <p>
              In almost all cases, these marks express a clear desire not to be
              limited to Cartesian logic and to a single response — which of
              course can be reductive. This critique comes up in the comments as
              well.
            </p>
            <h2>Why are there so many dots in the center?</h2>
            <p>
              On average, 5.5% of all answers are found at the center of the
              graphs (it oscillates between 3% and 11% from one graph to the
              next), which is not as much as it may seem. Still, it remains
              significant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the X/Y-axis structure of the graphs and the existential
              nature of the questions, the center was probably used as the
              default position whenever someone wanted to express neutrality
              and/or ambivalence, and/or the actual position where respondents
              see themselves, and/or a way to express “none of the above” or
              “all of the above.” (Among the respondents who left comments in
              the questionnaire, several wrote that only one dot could not
              adequately express their position.)
            </p>
            <h2>Respondent categories</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>
                This analysis considers all respondents together.{" "}
              </strong>
              Overall, there are no major differences between the responses of
              the populations of Montreal and Edmonton, nor between Francophones
              and Anglophones. However, to compare the different categories of
              respondents (Edmonton or Montreal, questionnaires in French or in
              English), go to “Visualization options,” click “Show respondents
              from…” and pick the groups you want. In “Graph type” you can
              select percentage to make it easier to compare.
            </p>
            <p>
              The respondents are museum and gallery goers, and as such are not
              necessarily representative of the general population.
            </p>
            <h2>Dates</h2>
            <p>
              It must be noted that the last questionnaires were handed on March
              7, 2020, just one week before the pandemic changed our lives. (How
              different would the answers be if the survey was to be conducted
              today? Given the nature of the questionnaire, would the pandemic
              be more of a distraction, or would it fundamentally alter how
              people think about these issues?)
            </p>
            <h2>Representation of the dots</h2>
            <p>
              In order to better show each individual dot on the scatterplot
              graphs, an algorithm was applied to slightly separate the dots
              from one another. (For example, if 35 respondents placed a dot
              exactly in the center, these dots are here presented not as a
              single dot but as a cluster of dots.)
            </p>
            <h2>Beware of numbers</h2>
            <p>
              The raison d'être of this questionnaire is above all to exist
              visually, and to question the way in which we consider issues of a
              qualitative nature. We live in a data-driven world, and numbers
              are often used to create a sense of knowledge, expertise, and
              predictability that hides the fundamental and radical uncertainty
              that defines the human condition. Here, we tried to balance the
              use of numbers and visuals to give you the best possible portrait
              of the results. But numbers can only give you the simplified
              portrait; always refer to the scatterplot graphs to interpret the
              numbers.

              This questionnaire was originally designed as part of my installation for the Sobey Art Award Exhibition, which took place at the Art Gallery of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada from October 5, 2019 to January 5, 2020.

              The diagrammatic structure of the questionnaire mirrors some of my paintings. I wanted to create an experience in which visitors could immerse themselves in the works not only by looking, but also by positioning themselves in relation to the same existential issues that I address in my work. Taking a position involves choosing this over that, which is to say, it implies a form of measurement. But a quantitative framework is inherently inappropriate to ponder on qualitative notions such as morality or progress. So I used a cartesian plane with X and Y axes (for its simplicity and familiarity), but I deliberately avoided presenting participants with precise grids, numbers and metrics. I didn’t want the focus to be on quantification, but on navigation — I wanted participants to navigate through different sets of issues put in relation with one another and find their own position as intuitively as possible. That is why this questionnaire, as opposed to most polls or surveys, deliberately avoided anything that can be measured objectively, such as age, income, ethnicity, and any question that can be answered by yes or no. The goal was to try to concretize, however modestly, the structure within which we consider big existential questions.
              <br />
              To make visitors engage in this experience was the essence of the project.

              Of course, legitimate criticism can be made about several aspects of the project — the binary nature of the questions, the choice of issues, my own biases as a white man, the loftiness inherent in asking big questions, and the tendency of such questions to bring back the old pitfalls of universalism. Despite these shortcomings, many more people than I expected took the time to complete the questionnaire and provided positive feedback, which signals that it might be worth pushing the experience further. I hope to develop a funkier questionnaire, where respondents could give multidimensional answers, express contradicting positions, critique the questions, etc. It seems relevant to develop experimental alternatives to conventional measurement systems and see what can be done with such methods.
